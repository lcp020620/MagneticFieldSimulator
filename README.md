# Magnetic Field Simulator
This simulates intensity and dirction of magnetic field of each location using Finite Element Method.
First, it devides given electric current shape into small vectors.
Second, using orthogonal coordinates and Biot-Savart Law, it calculates magnetic field generated by each small current vectors.
Finally, Three.js visualizes calculated magnetic field datas.

CUDA version 13.1, CUpy 13.6.0, numpy 2.4.0 was used.

Current objectives are written below.
    Make real-time interface between python and Three.js (via fastAPI)
    Make GUI
    Publish this project online (via runpod serverless, github page)
    Package this project and publish for free
